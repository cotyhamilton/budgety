# budgety

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that **budgety** is still under active development ‚ö†Ô∏è

## introduction

**budgety** is a local-first budgeting app built for the long now. Goodbye Mint ü´°

Inspired by the budgeting features of [Simple Bank](https://web.archive.org/web/20200906094047/https://www.simple.com/), it is an open source rewrite of my previous project https://www.avafinance.io with a facelift and offline capabilities.

This project will be built publicly and features will be user-driven.

## now todo

- core features proof of concept
- sync data between devices

## later todo

- end user docs
- budgeting automation with **rules**
- user controlled feature flags for ***everything***
    - emojify
    - alternate views/ui components (tabular vs cards)

- sql raw data access
- csv data import
- explore gamification ideas
